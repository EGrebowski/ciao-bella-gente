        <h2>Conversational Italian, Enthusiastically</h2>
        <p>“The Italian language is passionate, romantic, and exciting. I use all my energy to create that same experience in every lesson, and sincerely believe that’s why my students reach their goals.”</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">About Leona</h3>
            <div class="text-container col-8">
                <p>Having immigrated from Italy in 2010, Leona arrived in America as a young woman full of energy and the determination to blend into American culture. But anyone who meets Leona would instantly agree that she has wonderfully done so without compromising her unique traditional qualities. She’s fluent in 4 languages and spent the first stages of her career as a translator in both personal and business settings, but this hardly begins to capture her expertise. Leona’s students love their lessons, look forward to every session, and reach their goals - whether they be for communicating with family, preparing for travel, launching an international business, citizenship, or expressing love and romance (even wedding vows!) with the most passionate words.</p><br />
                <p>Read the testimonials from her students, purely their words, and decide for yourself if they are expressing a gratitude that’s simply not common in language lessons. The feelings are mutual. Leona adores her students, now good friends one and all.</p>

                <h4 class="subtitle">Unique Lesson Style</h4>
                <p>The key is flexibility, energy, and a comfortable environment. Leona meets her students in convenient locations that help them relax… coffee shops, bookstores, happy hours, and Skype when business and home obligations render a face-to-face difficult. Singles, couples, and group rates are available, weekday evenings and Saturday mornings. Lessons are highly conversational with an emphasis on proper grammar and recitation until pronunciation and inflection are correct. They read topical articles, talk about their days and families, and hear all about favorite Italian places and customs with tips for getting around town…. in a mix of Italian and English that changes as students grow more confident.</p>

            <p>"Around April of 2015, I decided once and for all I was going to learn to speak Italian. In large part because my wife-to-be and I were planning our upcoming wedding in Italy. I had already tried learning on my own with books, apps, and Rosetta Stone but hadn’t seen much progress, and I would have been setting myself up for embarrassment if I told an Italian speaker, “I speak Italian.” By that point I knew, short of moving to Italy, the only way I was ever going to really learn Italian was through lessons with an Italian speaker. That’s when I met Leona.</p><br />
            <p>I was lucky to find her because she is a wonderful teacher! We began meeting one-on-one, twice a week. She assessed my Italian and tailored each lesson for me. She was always prepared and made sure to provide me challenging new exercises each week, while also going back to cover my weak points from the lesson before. Leona was also always understanding and willing to accommodate my busy weekly schedule. Her flexibility and patience allowed me to stay on track. She also always made our lessons fun, which helped keep me stay committed. Before long, our conversations were almost exclusively in Italian.</p><br />
            <p>By the time our wedding arrived in August of 2016, I was able to carry a conversation in Italian. Sure, there was still a lot more for me to learn, but it was an exciting accomplishment! I had Leona to thank. And it made our wedding trip to Italy even more amazing.</p><br />
            <p>Following our trip, I continued my weekly lessons. By then, Leona and I had become friends, and I looked forward to each meeting. We’re still studying Italian weekly, and I can’t wait till my young son one day starts his own lessons with Leona. Now more than three years after my first lesson, each month that passes brings more excitement as I realize the strides I’m continuing to make with the Italian language, thanks to Leona!"</p>

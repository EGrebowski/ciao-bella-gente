            <div class="text-container col-8">
                <p>Having grown up in Rome, Leona immigrated to the United States in 2010. She has extensive experience as a
                    translator, is fluent in four languages, and has been teaching Italian for more than seven years. Leona’s
                    students love their lessons, look forward to every session, and, most importantly, reach their goals—whether
                    they be to communicate with family, prepare for travel, launch an international business, attain Italian
                    citizenship, or express love (even wedding vows!) with the most passionate words.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <span class="text-accent">Read the testimonials</span> from her students to see how they achieved their goals as they developed
                    a lasting friendship and gained a passion for the Italian language.

                <h4 class="subtitle">Unique Lesson Style</h4>
                <p>The keys to success are flexibility, energy, and a comfortable environment. Leona meets her students in convenient
                    locations that help them relax—coffee shops, bookstores, happy hours, and even Skype when a face-to-face
                    is difficult. Singles, couples, and group rates are available for weekday evenings and Saturday mornings.
                    Lessons are highly conversational with an emphasis on proper grammar and recitation until pronunciation
                    and inflection are correct. Students read topical articles, discuss their days and families, and hear
                    all about Italian places and customs with tips for getting around town…in a combination of Italian and
                    English that changes as students grow more confident.</p>

                        <p>"Around April of 2015, I decided once and for all I was going to learn to speak Italian. In large
                            part because my wife-to-be and I were planning our upcoming wedding in Italy. I had already tried
                            learning on my own with books, apps, and Rosetta Stone but hadn’t seen much progress, and I would
                            have been setting myself up for embarrassment if I told an Italian speaker, “I speak Italian.”
                            By that point I knew, short of moving to Italy, the only way I was ever going to really learn
                            Italian was through lessons with an Italian speaker. That’s when I met Leona.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>I was lucky to find her because she is a wonderful teacher! We began meeting one-on-one, twice a
                            week. She assessed my Italian and tailored each lesson for me. She was always prepared and made
                            sure to provide me challenging new exercises each week, while also going back to cover my weak
                            points from the lesson before. Leona was also always understanding and willing to accommodate
                            my busy weekly schedule. Her flexibility and patience allowed me to stay on track. She also always
                            made our lessons fun, which helped keep me stay committed. Before long, our conversations were
                            almost exclusively in Italian.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>By the time our wedding arrived in August of 2016, I was able to carry a conversation in Italian.
                            Sure, there was still a lot more for me to learn, but it was an exciting accomplishment! I had
                            Leona to thank. And it made our wedding trip to Italy even more amazing.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Following our trip, I continued my weekly lessons. By then, Leona and I had become friends, and I
                            looked forward to each meeting. We’re still studying Italian weekly, and I can’t wait till my
                            young son one day starts his own lessons with Leona. Now more than three years after my first
                            lesson, each month that passes brings more excitement as I realize the strides I’m continuing
                            to make with the Italian language, thanks to Leona!"</p>

                            vocabulary, dialogue practice and spontaneous conversation thrown in. Recently my wife and our
                            two friends were in Sicily. The best testimonial I can give Leona was when we attended a cooking
                            school. The Chef asked our driver if any of us spoke Italian. The driver responded, 'Jerry speaks
                            Italian.' I felt great. Grazie Mille Leona."

                            throughout the past three years, a testament to making time to learn a new language even after
                            years of a very busy and successful practice. I am so proud to see him achieve membership in
                            the Italian Club in Ybor and contribute to their Italian festivals, activities, and events. Thank
                            you Dr. Jerry for your remarkable success in life, not only as a psychologist but also as a wonderful
                            student and friend."</p>

                            with my Nonna. Leona has a passion for Italian culture and language that is evident the second
                            you meet her. She grew up in Italy and is eager to share her love of the country. In fact, when
                            I told her I was thinking about a destination wedding there, she went above and beyond to recommend
                            places and help me along the way. She is patient, kind, motivating, and is fully invested in
                            her students progress. I can definitely say that I gained an amazing mentor, teacher, and friend!"</p>

                            my speaking abilities, I eventually connected with Leona and began taking lessons from her. Since
                            my trip was focused on the art of winemaking and viticulture, so were our lessons, with an emphasis
                            on ease of communication. The trip was a great experience and I definitely used my newly acquired
                            language skills, although I still have a lot to learn from Leona. Presently I am working to become
                            an Italian citizen and can speak, read, write, and comprehend at a intermediate level, still
                            taking lessons from Leona. She is a great teacher and I recommend her to anyone."</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>I made the right choice by committing myself for almost two years to studying Italian, twice a week,
                            with Leona. Her style of teaching was energetic, intense and fun at the same time. She was very
                            flexible with the schedule which helped tremendously with my busy work schedule at the time.
                            She was very excited to help me converse in Italian and was essential in helping me prepare for
                            my present life in Italy. Now I speak Italian fluently and run a Culinary Vacation Program in
                            a large villa in the Roman countryside. It’s the heart of Italy. I enjoy teaching people about
                            the culture, history, and cuisine of Italy, my new home.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Grazie Leona, for helping make my dream come true!</p>

                        <p>"If you are truly serious about learning Italian, you have to reach out to Leona. My wife and I truly
                            love Italy and the Italian culture and we have made it our goal to learn the language so we can
                            interact with the locals when we visit. Since we have different learning styles, Leona has been
                            exceptional in customizing our learning plan so we both get as much as we can out of the studies.
                            In addition, she not only teaches us the language, but she also teaches us the culture. If you’ve
                            ever been to Italy, you know that this piece of it is just as important as the spoken dialect.
                            You simply cannot get this kind of experience from an online app or program. We have been with
                            Leona for about 3 months and don’t intend to stop until we are fluent! We always look forward
                            to our lessons with her because she is extremely knowledgeable and patient and truly embodies
                            the Italian culture. We highly recommend Leona and, when you reach out to her, we’re confident
                            you will feel the same way!"

                        <p>“My daughter has always wanted to learn to speak Italian, and the wedding of a family friend in Florence
                            was the perfect motivation to begin. While we weren’t seeking to become fluent, we wanted to
                            be able to speak and understand at a conversational level during the trip. Upon meeting Leona,
                            we had an instant connection with her! She is so warm and friendly, and yet very confident and
                            professional, getting right down to basic conversational Italian. We met for an hour every Monday
                            evening, and always looked forward to our lessons and enjoyed every minute. As we grew more conversant,
                            the lessons felt more like friends getting together for a visit—we spoke in Italian and had a
                            great time, while Leona listened, guided, and corrected, making it easy for us to understand.
                            In addition to our conversations, we used workbooks and handouts to enhance and supplement our
                            study and practice at home. Leona was patient, but kept us advancing at a reasonable rate. By
                            the time we got to Italy, we were able to converse with locals in the airport, taxis, hotels,
                            and restaurants, and it was so much fun to use what Leona taught us. Since she lived in Rome,
                            she also gave us practical advice for getting around the city, points of interest, and information
                            about Italian customs and life in general. We received a first-rate, well-rounded education from
                            Leona, and gained a wonderful friend in the process. We highly recommend her to anyone seeking
                            to learn Italian.”</p>

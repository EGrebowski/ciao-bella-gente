        <h2>Conversational Italian, Enthusiastically</h2>

            <div class="text-container col-8">
                <p>Having immigrated from Italy in 2010, Leona arrived in America as a young woman full of energy and the determination to blend into American culture. But anyone who meets Leona would instantly agree that she has wonderfully done so without compromising her unique traditional qualities. She’s fluent in 4 languages and spent the first stages of her career as a translator in both personal and business settings, but this hardly begins to capture her expertise. Leona’s students love their lessons, look forward to every session, and reach their goals - whether they be for communicating with family, preparing for travel, launching an international business, citizenship, or expressing love and romance (even wedding vows!) with the most passionate words.</p><br />
                <p>Read the testimonials from her students, purely their words, and decide for yourself if they are expressing a gratitude that’s simply not common in language lessons. The feelings are mutual. Leona adores her students, now good friends one and all.</p>

                <h4 class="subtitle">Unique Lesson Style</h4>
                <p>The key is flexibility, energy, and a comfortable environment. Leona meets her students in convenient locations that help them relax… coffee shops, bookstores, happy hours, and Skype when business and home obligations render a face-to-face difficult. Singles, couples, and group rates are available, weekday evenings and Saturday mornings. Lessons are highly conversational with an emphasis on proper grammar and recitation until pronunciation and inflection are correct. They read topical articles, talk about their days and families, and hear all about favorite Italian places and customs with tips for getting around town…. in a mix of Italian and English that changes as students grow more confident.</p>

            <p>"Around April of 2015, I decided once and for all I was going to learn to speak Italian. In large part because my wife-to-be and I were planning our upcoming wedding in Italy. I had already tried learning on my own with books, apps, and Rosetta Stone but hadn’t seen much progress, and I would have been setting myself up for embarrassment if I told an Italian speaker, “I speak Italian.” By that point I knew, short of moving to Italy, the only way I was ever going to really learn Italian was through lessons with an Italian speaker. That’s when I met Leona.</p><br />
            <p>I was lucky to find her because she is a wonderful teacher! We began meeting one-on-one, twice a week. She assessed my Italian and tailored each lesson for me. She was always prepared and made sure to provide me challenging new exercises each week, while also going back to cover my weak points from the lesson before. Leona was also always understanding and willing to accommodate my busy weekly schedule. Her flexibility and patience allowed me to stay on track. She also always made our lessons fun, which helped keep me stay committed. Before long, our conversations were almost exclusively in Italian.</p><br />
            <p>By the time our wedding arrived in August of 2016, I was able to carry a conversation in Italian. Sure, there was still a lot more for me to learn, but it was an exciting accomplishment! I had Leona to thank. And it made our wedding trip to Italy even more amazing.</p><br />
            <p>Following our trip, I continued my weekly lessons. By then, Leona and I had become friends, and I looked forward to each meeting. We’re still studying Italian weekly, and I can’t wait till my young son one day starts his own lessons with Leona. Now more than three years after my first lesson, each month that passes brings more excitement as I realize the strides I’m continuing to make with the Italian language, thanks to Leona!"</p>

            <p>"If you are truly serious about learning Italian, you have to reach out to Leona. My wife and I truly love Italy and the Italian culture and we have made it our goal to learn the language so we can interact with the locals when we visit. Since we have different learning styles, Leona has been exceptional in customizing our learning plan so we both get as much as we can out of the studies. In addition, she not only teaches us the language, but she also teaches us the culture. If you’ve ever been to Italy, you know that this piece of it is just as important as the spoken dialect. You simply cannot get this kind of experience from an online app or program. We have been with Leona for about 3 months and don’t intend to stop until we are fluent! We always look forward to our lessons with her because she is extremely knowledgeable and patient and truly embodies the Italian culture. We highly recommend Leona and, when you reach out to her, we’re confident you will feel the same way!"</p>

            <p>"I have always loved Italian language and culture, and I decided to learn the language in advance of a two week trip to Italy. After struggling to use apps like Duolingo and Memrise to improve my speaking abilities, I eventually connected with Leona and began taking lessons from her. Since my trip was focused on the art of winemaking and viticulture, so were our lessons, with an emphasis on ease of communication. The trip was a great experience and I definitely used my newly acquired language skills, although I still have a lot to learn from Leona. Presently I am working to become an Italian citizen and can speak, read, write, and comprehend at a intermediate level, still taking lessons from Leona. She is a great teacher and I recommend her to anyone."</p>

            <p>"Ciao! So, that's about the only word I knew when I started my Italian lessons. I found Leona about a year and a half ago as I was looking for a teacher to help me finally be able to speak fluently with my Nonna. Leona has a passion for Italian culture and language that is evident the second you meet her. She grew up in Italy and is eager to share her love of the country. In fact, when I told her I was thinking about a destination wedding there, she went above and beyond to recommend places and help me along the way. She is patient, kind, motivating, and is fully invested in her students progress. I can definitely say that I gained an amazing mentor, teacher, and friend!"</p>

            <p>"I have been taking lessons from Leona for 2 years. Her lessons have a good mix of talking and listening, vocabulary, dialogue practice and spontaneous conversation thrown in. Recently my wife and our two friends were in Sicily. The best testimonial I can give Leona was when we attended a cooking school. The Chef asked our driver if any of us spoke Italian. The driver responded, 'Jerry speaks Italian.' I felt great. Grazie Mille Leona."</p>

            <p>"Our family was invited to a wedding in Florence in June of 2017. My daughter has always wanted to learn to speak Italian, so the wedding, and the 10 days we were going to spend in Florence and Rome, gave us an extra good reason to begin. We didn't necessarily seek to become fluent, but wanted to be able to speak and understand at a conversational level when we were there. We first met with Leona in the fall of 2016, and had an instant connection with her! She is so warm and friendly, and yet very confident and professional, getting right down to beginning with basic conversational Italian. We met every Monday evening for an hour for several months. We looked forward to our lessons and enjoyed every minute. As we grew more conversant, the lessons felt more like friends getting together for a visit...we spoke in Italian, as best we could, and had a great time. But all the while, Leona was listening and guiding and correcting, making it so easy for us to understand. In addition to our conversations, we had workbooks and handouts that enhanced our study and practice at home. She was very patient, but kept us advancing at a reasonable rate so we would be ready for our trip. By the time we got to Italy, we were able to converse with people we met in the airport, in taxis, hotels and restaurants, and it was so much fun to use what Leona had taught us. Since she has lived in Rome, she was able to give us practical advice for getting around the city, points of interest not to miss and information about Italian customs and life in general. We feel that we received a first rate, well-rounded education from Leona, and gained a wonderful friend as well. We would highly recommend her to anyone seeking to learn to speak Italian on any level."</p>
